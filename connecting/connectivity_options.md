# Connectivity options on IBM Cloud
{: #connect_options}

{{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} offers multiple secure connectivity options for your application connection requirements.  
{: shortdesc} 


## Connecting to a public endpoint (default option)
{: #pub_endpt}

As with any public cloud service, you can connect your application by way of a public host name that is provided to you at the time that your service is provisioned. Access to your data is protected by strong authentication, vast Db2 authorization options and access controls, encryption over the wire and at rest, and IBM security and compliance practices for development and operations. Optional IP allowlisting is offered. Create an IBM Support case if you want to enable IP allowlisting.

For application connections, do not use IP addresses to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance, as the IP addresses resolved from the hostname may change. Use hostnames to reference your connection properties where it is available.

### How to connect to a public endpoint:
{: #pub_endpt_steps}

The easiest way to connect to your data warehouse is by way of the public host name that was provided in your welcome letter. You can also obtain your host name and credentials in the following way:

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and click your service instance.
2. Click **Service credentials**.
3. Click **New credential**, then click **Add**.
4. After the credentials are created, under the `Actions` column, click **View credentials**.
5. In the following JSON document example, note the contents of the hostname, password, and username fields. You use these three components to make the public endpoint connection:

   ```
   {
     "hostname": "db2whoc-flex-xxxxxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net",
     "password": "DTPY7KXxhp_pKtjLSt",
     "https_url": "https://db2whoc-flex-xxxxxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net",
     "port": 50000,
     "ssldsn": "DATABASE=BLUDB;HOSTNAME=db2whoc-flex-xxxxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net;PORT=50001;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=bluadmin;PWD=DTPY7KXWxhp_pKtjLSt;Security=SSL;",
     "host": "db2whoc-flex-xxxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net",
     "jdbcurl": "jdbc:db2://db2whoc-flex-xxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net:50000/BLUDB",
     "uri": "db2://bluadmin:DTPY7KXx1p_pKtjLSt@db2whoc-flex-hyftpsb.services.dal.bluemix.net:50000/BLUDB",
     "db": "BLUDB",
     "dsn": "DATABASE=BLUDB;HOSTNAME=db2whoc-flex-xxxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=bluadmin;PWD=DTPYZunlWxhp_pKtjLSt;",
     "username": "bluadmin",
     "ssljdbcurl": "jdbc:db2://db2whoc-flex-xxxx.services.dal.bluemix.net:50001/BLUDB:sslConnection=true;"
   }

   ```

## Connecting to a private endpoint: IBM Cloud service endpoint
{: #priv_endpt}

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} supports private connectivity through an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint](/docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview). {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints securely route network traffic between different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private backplane network. When you configure your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint connectivity, traffic between your cloud data warehouse and applications deployed on your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account will not traverse any public networks.

### How to configure IBM Cloud service endpoint connectivity
{: #cfg_endpt}

Complete the following steps to enable {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint connectivity for your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance:

1. Enable your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to use virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoints. To enable both of these items, see [Enabling VRF and service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint).

2. Configure your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance for service endpoint connectivity.

   - **If you provisioned your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog**: [Create a case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to request the configuration of your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint connectivity. After this is complete, your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance will be served on a new, non-internet-routable IP address. Information about how to access your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance by using this newly configured private endpoint will be sent to you.

   - **If you purchased your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance through IBM Sales**: If you requested private endpoint connectivity, your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance will be provisioned with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint connectivity. No further action is required.

After you've configured {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint connectivity for your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance, it will only be accessible through a private endpoint. You will not be able to access your instance through a public endpoint.
{: note}

To learn more about the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service endpoint service, see [Secure access to services using service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview).

## Connecting to a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint
{: #vpn}

If you have an application that is deployed on a private network that is outside of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} without access to the public internet and you want to connect it to your database over a virtual private network (VPN) connection, you can make the request at the time that you order the service or by opening an IBM Support case. IBM network engineers will assist your network engineers to set up the VPN tunnel between your private network and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

### How to connect to a VPN endpoint
{: #priv_endpt_vpn_steps}

To establish a VPN connection to your cloud data warehouse behind a public endpoint, [create an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add){:external} that includes the following details:

* **Type of support**: Technical 
* **Category**: Databases 
* **Offering**: select your {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} instance 
* **Subject**: VPN Connection Request 
* **Description**: provide the following required information
  * **Customer-side VPN Peer Address** (your VPN endpoint): `<IP Address>`
  * **Customer-side Encryption Domain** (be specific about what is required â€“ 10.0.0.0/8 is unworkable because 10 addressing is also used within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} for back-end services): `<Domain>`
  * **Customer-side VPN Hardware & Version**: `<Hardware and Version number>`
  * **Customer-side VPN Contact** (technical contact name and email address): 
    * `<Name>` 
    * `<Title>` 
    * `<Email Address>`

  **Optional** (change only if the following default values are not suitable):

  *IKE/ISAKMP Parameters (Phase I)*

  * **Encryption Method**: IKEv1
  * **IKE Encryption / Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
  * **Authentication Algorithm**: SHA1
  * **DH-Group**: Group 5
  * **Security Association Lifetime (seconds)**: 1d (86400 seconds)

  *IPSec Parameters (Phase II)*

  * **IPSec Encryption / Encryption Algorithm**: AES-256
  * **Authentication Algorithm**: SHA1
  * **DH-Group** (if using PF-Secrecy): Group 5
  * **Security Association Lifetime (seconds)**: 3600 seconds

After receipt of your request, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} technicians will open the appropriate firewall ports and allowlist the provided IP address. Communication and resolution to the request is made through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support case ticket.
