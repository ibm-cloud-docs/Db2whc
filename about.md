## Key features
{: #key_features}

### Blazingly-fast engine

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} is a column-organized, in-memory data warehouse designed for complex analytics and extreme concurrency. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} delivers high performance on complex analytics workloads by using IBM BLU Acceleration, a collection of technologies pioneered by IBM Research that features the following key optimizations: 
- A columnar organized storage model 
- In-memory processing 
- Querying of compressed data sets
- Data skipping

### Scalable and elastic cloud service

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} is an elastic service, and allows you to independently scale compute and storage through an intuitive UI or REST API.

### Expertly managed and highly secure

Day-to-day operations for {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}}, including database monitoring, uptime checks and failovers, are fully automated. Operations are supplemented by a DevOps team that are on call to handle unexpected system failures. Data is encrypted at rest and in motion by default. Administrators can also restrict access to sensitive data through data masking, row permissions, and role-based security, and can utilize database audit utilities to maintain audit trails for their data warehouse.

### Highly resilient and reliable

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} provides double protection for your data with built-in snapshot backups and geo-replicated disaster recovery backups.

### Compatible with on-premises data warehouses​

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} can be configured with Oracle compatibility, so applications that were written for an Oracle database can run against {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} without having to be rewritten. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} also comes with nearly 100% DDL, DML, and stored procedure compatibility with IBM Netezza®.

### Built-in machine learning and geospatial capabilities​

Train and run machine learning models directly in the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} engine, using SQL, Python, or R. {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} also supports spatial analytics with Esri compatibility, including Esri data types such as GML, and integration with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Plans and configurations
{: #plans_cfgs}

{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} offers several elastic data warehouse configurations to meet your workload requirements:

- **Flex One**: a single-partitioned plan designed for growing enterprises and new data warehouse projects.
- **Flex**: a multi-partitioned plan designed for storage-dense workloads, inexpensive querying of large data sets, and development and test environments.
- **Flex Performance**: a multi-partitioned plan designed for high-performance, production workloads that prioritize compute performance over storage density.

All plans offer the [key features](#key_features) described in the previous section.
