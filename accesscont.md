# Access Control
{: #access control}

Audit and Privileges view access should be secured. Security administrative access should only be given to authorized users. Audit policy defined and in use views should never be available to the PUBLIC. Privileges view should not be available to PUBLIC. The service will reinforce this with every update.

There may be certain use cases where you will need to deviate from the secured configuration. If you wish to keep this as a permanent setting, please contact IBM Support.
